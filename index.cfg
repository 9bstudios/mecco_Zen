<!-- TODO:

Where i can find "Rectangle" tool in UV Tab ? I failed to find it in Zen uv Tabl!
I remmenber modo add "Rectangle" tool to UV Tab since modo 9.X . Maybe you missed it .


Here some my suggestions hope they are useful for you !

I think we do not need just copy Game tab from modo only .

The Game tab just a place where modo put two kits in it in my opinion.

It is very hard to stay in "Game Tools" tab always.We still need to switch different tab two times at least to complete a operation .It is very low efficiency .

we still need to reorganize it to opimize our workflow.

I like Zen's work flow .

Model >Topo> UV> Paint Or Sculpt > Setup >Animate and next ? 'Export custom assets to game engine' ?

"Game Tool" what it can do for us .I think it is "Check ,Custom and Export data to different game engine"

Zen is very good that combine Model tool to one tab . So when i in different mode , i do not need to switch tab again and again.

Model Tab

We can put the Vertex Normal Toolkit to Model tab except "Morph Push Tool ,Add Cage View" and "Assign Tanget Vectors" to Model tab.
"Assign Tanget Vectors" " Vertex Normal Toolkit" And "Align Normals" can have same own category .

Maybe we can add "Drag Weld" to "Merge Tool" button just like "Edge Slice" ,so when we hold click left mouse ,we can choose "Drag Weld"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Topo Tab

We have new tools "Retopo Guides" "Automatic Retopology" after update to 10.2 , hope you can add it to zen.

We can put "Bake Items and Baking Tools" from "Game Tab"and "Morph Push Tool and Add Cage View" from "Vertex Normal Toolkit" to Topo Tab . Combine with old baking tool.It will make topo and baking map workflow more efficiency.

We also can add a button to open UV tab in Topo Tab. So we still can tweak UV when in topo or baking stage ,don't need to switch UV tab, again,we can keep UV and Topo tab in one viewport meanwhile.

Game Tab

Now "Game Tab " can show all export Tools. When we finish asset , we can switch Game tab to check and export data to game engine .


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it possible some commands to Zen ? Small but very usefull.

Export selected layers , Merge meshes, Umerge mesh from item list. Maybe we need a quick way to copy cut and past polygons in Mesh or betwen different meshes.

"Rest, Freeze, Zero ' commands From "Item properties" when you import meshes from other 3d software , you need these commans in most time . It just like xform in Max. -->
