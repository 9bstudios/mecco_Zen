      <h1>Zen Release Notes</h1>

      <h2>10.7.0</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Optional Hotkey Mapping</h3>
          Preferences > Mechanical Color > Zen UI > Map Default Zen Hotkeys...
          Now provides a list of checkboxes for each hotkey. You can choose which
          to map and which to ignore.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Hotkey Changes</h3>
          'V' and 'G' keys are no longer mapped by default. You will need to add
          these manually using the Zen UI preferences, either using the newly-improved
          "Map Default Zen Hotkeys..." utility or by manually setting hotkeys using
          the individual form mapping buttons below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Zen UI Preferences</h3>
          Hotkey preferences can now be reverted back to their factory defaults
          (rather than simply clearing them, as before). Recommended hotkey
          suggestions are included in button labels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Right-handed layout option</h3>
          Lists and toolboxes can now be displayed on the right using the
          "Right-Handed List Buttons" toggle in the Zen UI preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Toolbox Updates</h3>
          Toolbox now includes "Poly Reduction" and "Add Point" tools where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>New/Updated install alerts</h3>
          When new versions of Zen are installed or updated, an alert will fire
          to remind you to reset your MODO preferences. Afterwards, the release
          notes will be opened in a new browser window.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bug fix: Performance</h3>
          A significant lag when RMB clicking in extremely large scene files is fixed.
          You may now right-click with impunity.
        </li>
