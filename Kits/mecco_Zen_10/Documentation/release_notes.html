      <h1>Zen Release Notes</h1>
      <h2>10.8.0</h2>

      <div class="alert"><b>System > Reset Preferences</b> is required for this update.</div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Lots more toolboxes</h3>
          The 'V' key toolbox and the 'mini' toolbox on the left side are now always
          in sync, showing the toolbox specified in the "Toolbox" popup. The popup
          is available at the bottom left of Zen in the footer bar, or at the top
          of the 'V' key toolbox just below the tool modes icons. We've added tons
          of previously-missing toolbars (hair, particle paint, vertex maps, command regions,
          inverse kinematics, and tons of others).
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Smarter, more consistent toolboxes</h3>
          In addition to adding new toolboxes, the existing ones have been cleaned up
          and streamlined, removing redundancy and putting things in more predictable
          places. This is an ongoing effort. Let us know if anything could be better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Layout improvements</h3>
          The Zen layout has been updated and improved, adding an item properties and
          channels list to the sidebar, separating the dopesheet from the other frames
          on the lower half (for independent sizing and simultaneous use), and several
          other changes necessary for the new retopology improvements (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Retopology improvements</h3>
          There is now a dedicated retopology toolbox in the 'V' key and 'mini' toolbars,
          and a separate viewport for retopology vs normal modeling. We tried very
          hard to make it possible to both model and retopo in a single viewport, but
          it simply wasn't feasible with the MODO viewport system. The new solution is much
          more consistent, and not too much hassle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Quad modeling viewport</h3>
          The default modeling viewport is now a maximized quad-modeling viewport. To
          work in quad mode, click the yellow 'maximize' button at the top right of the
          modeling viewport. You can, of course, maximize it again the same way.
          This one was acctually added in 10.7.0, but we forgot to announce it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
          Cameras and lights are now visible by default in the model viewport.
          The graph editor works better and more consistently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10.7.0</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Hotkey Mapping Options</h3>
          Preferences > Mechanical Color > Zen UI > Map Default Zen Hotkeys...
          Now provides a list of checkboxes for each hotkey. You can choose which
          to map and which to ignore.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Hotkey Defaults</h3>
          'V' and 'G' keys are no longer mapped by default. You will need to add
          these manually using the Zen UI preferences, either using the newly-improved
          "Map Default Zen Hotkeys..." utility or by manually setting hotkeys using
          the individual form mapping buttons below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Revert Hotkeys</h3>
          Hotkey preferences can now be reverted back to their factory defaults
          (rather than simply clearing them, as before). Recommended hotkey
          suggestions are included in button labels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Right-handed layout option</h3>
          Lists and toolboxes can now be displayed on the right using the
          "Right-Handed List Buttons" toggle in the Zen UI preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Toolbox Updates</h3>
          Toolbox now includes "Poly Reduction" and "Add Point" tools where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>New/Updated install alerts</h3>
          When new versions of Zen are installed or updated, an alert will fire
          to remind you to reset your MODO preferences. Afterwards, the release
          notes will be opened in a new browser window.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bug fix: Topo Mode viewport shading</h3>
          Viewport shading modes now remember their state when toggling topo mode.
          This fixes various viewport shading related issues related to zen topo mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bug fix: Performance</h3>
          A significant lag when RMB clicking in extremely large scene files is fixed.
          You may now right-click with impunity.
        </li>
